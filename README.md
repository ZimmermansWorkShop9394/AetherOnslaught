This is a "space invaders" style game called Aether Onslaught.  It was completly written in GROK.  You will need python installed to run the game.  
Download all files to a directory on you computer then run the python script.  
Feel free to modify this or do whatever with it as it was just an exersize for me to see if I could do it.
You can find me on my YouTube Channel "Zimmerman's Workshop" or @zimmermansworkshop9394.
