This is a "space invaders" style game called Aether Onslaught.  It was completly written in GROK.  
You will need python installed to run the game.  
Download download the zip file and extract it to a folder.
Run the python script and play.
if you wish press the B button to diable bombs.
There are 10 levels then the game repeats levels to infinity.
Feel free to modify this or do whatever with it as it was just an exersize for me to see if I could do it.
You can find me on my YouTube Channel "Zimmerman's Workshop" or @zimmermansworkshop9394.
